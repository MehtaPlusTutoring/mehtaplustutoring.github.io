Inspired by their great-great-grandfather who taught princesses in India and started his own school, the Mehta siblings started MehtA+ Tutoring to share their love for learning. In high school, both siblings received a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam (12th grade course) in 8th grade, were valedictorians of their high school, received 36 on their ACTs, were National Merit Finalists, are award-winning authors in a prestigious social science journal and cofounded a club where they applied engineering skills for social good.</p>

Our A+ instruction not only prepares students to get accepted to their dream colleges, but also more importantly thrive in their dream colleges. The MehtA+ Tutoring teaching team has taught more than 300 students who have received 30+ scores on their ACT, perfect scores on SAT subject tests, learned some of the most in-demand skills in the job market and have been admitted to some of the top most universities in the countries such as Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, UPenn, Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins and UIUC.</p>
